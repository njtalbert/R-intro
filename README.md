Hello and welcome to the tutorial files for the introduction to R session.

If you haven't already, download R and R Studio here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Please download the R script file (R-intro.R) on this page, as it should help you follow along in the learning session. 

Here are a few additional resources to help you learn R.

-Just Enough R (web book): https://benwhalley.github.io/just-enough-r/

-Learning Statistics in R (another ebook): https://ademos.people.uic.edu/

-R Programming 101 (a great set of tutorials starting from the very basics): https://www.youtube.com/@RProgramming101

-Data Daft (dplyr tutorials for the useful pipe and select functions): https://www.youtube.com/@DataDaft

-R Bloggers (search within this site for answers to your questions): https://www.r-bloggers.com/

In general, I've found YouTube, ChatGPT (or you language model of choice), and occasionally StackOverflow to be helpful.
